## About

Cake Store RESTful API is a backend application built using Go programming language and MySQL database. It provides a set of endpoints to manage cake data in a cake store. With this API, you can perform operations such as retrieving all cakes, getting a cake by ID, adding a new cake, updating an existing cake, and deleting a cake.

This API follows RESTful guidelines and is designed to be scalable and easy to use. It leverages the power of Go to provide efficient and high-performance data operations. The MySQL database is used to store and retrieve cake data.
